## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **TrayApplication.cs**: Main application logic and UI
- **GlobalKeyboardHook.cs**: Low-level keyboard hook implementation
- **Program.cs**: Application entry point

The app uses:
- Windows Forms for tray interface
- Low-level keyboard hooks for global hotkey detection
- Clipboard operations with smart change detection
- SendKeys for text manipulation

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

Right-click the tray icon to access:
- **About**: View current timing settings and version info
- **Exit**: Close the application

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Administrator privileges** may be required for global keyboard hooks
- **Only affects letters** - numbers and symbols remain unchanged
- **Clipboard-safe** - your original clipboard content is always restored
- **Performance optimized** - uses smart waiting instead of fixed delays
